Reusable workflows for Wisconsin legal research, citation verification, and legal
drafting. Originally developed for Claude, the same skill folders now support
Claude Code, Codex, other Agent Skills hosts, and selective prompt use in ChatGPT
or other LLM applications. Tool availability determines what each host can do.

Each folder contains a `SKILL.md` entrypoint, focused references, and any scripts
or templates it needs. The legal text has one maintained source; vendor-specific
metadata does not create a second version of the law.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Included tools |
|---|---|---|
| [cite-check](skills/cite-check/SKILL.md) | Inventory citation uses; check quotations, pincites, treatment, proposition support, form, and record references against actual sources. | A hash-bound evidence log, text-quotation matcher, and report generator. A report records documented checks; it cannot perform legal judgment or a citator search itself. |
| [wisconsin-legal-writing](skills/wisconsin-legal-writing/SKILL.md) | Draft and review Wisconsin filings, correspondence, discovery responses, and research memoranda using the actual court, posture, and signer. | A **circuit-court** DOCX builder, 11 JSON specifications, and 14 Word templates. The appellate brief, letter, and memorandum templates are maintained separately. |
| [wisconsin-legal-interpretation](skills/wisconsin-legal-interpretation/SKILL.md) | Apply Wisconsin's interpretive method, distinguish binding and persuasive authority, and test contested readings. | Three work modes, a formal-memo template, and a structural linter. A passing lint result does not establish legal accuracy. |

The [September 20, 2026 assessment](docs/ASSESSMENT-2026-09-20.md) explains the
substantive corrections, implementation changes, validation, and remaining limits.

## Install or adapt

Copy a **complete skill folder** to a new installation target after checking for
an existing copy and local changes:

| Host | Project installation | Personal installation |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` | `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` |

Ask for the task, or invoke `/<skill-name>` in Claude Code or `$<skill-name>` in
Codex. The optional `agents/openai.yaml` files supply Codex display metadata.

For Claude skill upload, use one packaged skill ZIP and the account's supported
import flow. For ChatGPT, custom GPTs, and other chat/API hosts, supply the
entrypoint and task-relevant references as instructions, attachments, or retrieved
context. This does not create browsing, Python, storage, or database access.
See [portability and capability profiles](docs/PORTABILITY.md) for exact boundaries
and prompt-export instructions.

## Local tools and validation

Use **Python 3.10 or later**. The filing builder requires `python-docx`; metadata
validation requires `PyYAML`. The citation tool and memo linter use the standard
library. From the repository root:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/skill_tools.py validate
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/skill_tools.py package --out dist/skills
```

Choose a new package output directory. Each deterministic ZIP contains one complete
skill folder, its MIT license, legal notice, and a checksum manifest. CI runs the checks on
Windows and Linux with Python 3.10 and 3.12.

Build a fill-in circuit-court template with explicit draft mode:

```sh
python skills/wisconsin-legal-writing/scripts/build_filing.py --spec skills/wisconsin-legal-writing/assets/01-motion.json --out motion-draft.docx --draft
```

Existing output files are preserved unless `--overwrite` is explicitly supplied.
Draft mode permits unresolved placeholders. Without it, the builder performs
additional input checks, but neither mode certifies a document for filing. Inspect
the rendered pages, governing requirements, factual support, and actual signatures.
Appellate output must use the separate appellate template and current Rule 809.19.

See the [citation tool guide](skills/cite-check/references/evidence-tool.md) for
evidence-log commands, and the [interpretation README](skills/wisconsin-legal-interpretation/README.md)
for formal-memo validation.

## Verification and maintenance

Skill text is a research aid, not retrieved authority. Verify the controlling
version, court, jurisdiction, primary text, and relevant subsequent treatment when
using it. Record the checks actually performed. Identify missing source access or
citator coverage explicitly; never infer a completed check from a template, an
LLM's confidence, or a successful script.

Court rules and orders control over typography preferences. Preserve the user's
actual facts, role, voice, and authorized scope. A drafting request does not itself
direct filing or service. Keep private matter files and credentials out of this
public repository.

After reviewed changes, refresh manifests with
`python scripts/skill_tools.py manifest`, then rerun validation and relevant tests.
Rebuild and visually inspect affected Word templates after specification or layout
changes. Recheck current primary law before revising legal guidance. These aids do
not replace matter-specific legal review or any professional review required by law.
