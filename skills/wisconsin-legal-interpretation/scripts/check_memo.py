check_memo.py — structural lint for a wisconsin-legal-interpretation research memo.

This checks what a machine can check: that the memo's structure is present, that quotes
carry pincites, that the authority table is filled in rather than templated, that nothing
is silently unverified, and that the red team section exists and says something.

It cannot check whether the law is right. That is the red team's job. A clean run here
means the memo is auditable, not that it is correct.

# Why these fields are enums and not sentences.
#
# The three claims this linter has to police -- was a citator run, was the red
# team run, were there FATAL findings -- are claims made by the same author the
# check exists to police. An earlier version tested them by pattern-matching the
# author's prose. That cannot work: a word-list over free text is defeated by a
# synonym, another language, a homoglyph, or an abbreviation, and it
# simultaneously produces false accusations against honest authors whose wording
# happens to contain "no".
#
# So the checkable claims are constrained tokens with no room to be clever in,
# and every narrative belongs in a *_notes field the linter never parses. Prose
# is still scanned, but only to raise a MISMATCH when what the memo says and
# what its fields declare disagree -- which is a useful signal in both
# directions and is never the sole basis for a pass.
